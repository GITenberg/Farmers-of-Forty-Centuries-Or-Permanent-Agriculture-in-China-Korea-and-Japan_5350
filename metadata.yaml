description: "In 1909, American agronomist F.H. King toured China, Korea and Japan,\
  \ studying traditional fertilization, tillage and general farming practices. He\
  \ wrote his observations and findings in Farmers of Forty Centuries, Or Permanent\
  \ Agriculture in China, Korea, and Japan (1911, published shortly after his death\
  \ by his wife, Carrie Baker King; numerous facsimile reprintings, including Courier\
  \ Dover Publications, ISBN 0-486-43609-8, and Rodale Press, ISBN 0-87857-867-6).\
  \ King lived in an era preceding synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production and before\
  \ the use of the internal combustion engine for farm machinery, yet he was profoundly\
  \ interested in the challenge of farming the same soils in a 'permanent' manner,\
  \ hence his interest in the agricultural practices of ancient cultures. In recent\
  \ years, his book became an important organic farming reference.\n From Wikipedia\
